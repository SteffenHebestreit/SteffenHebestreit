## âœ¨ What I do

*   Technical Leadership
*   Software Architecture
*   Fullstack Development
*   Consulting

I'm always looking to stay up-to-date on the latest trends and technologies in software engineering. Ready to build custom applications, microservices, AI-powered workflows/agents, or MCP-server.

## ðŸš€ Featured Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm working on:

*   **[spring-boot-ai-chat-dockerized](https://github.com/SteffenHebestreit/spring-boot-ai-chat-dockerized):** An AI research project featuring a Spring Boot backend (`spring_boot_ai_agent`) and a modern frontend (`ai-chat-frontend`), all containerized with Docker Compose. This project bundles both the agent and frontend, and also includes an integrated WebCrawl MCP server. It integrates multiple LLMs (like Qwen 3, Google Gemma 3, DeepSeek R1), supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool integration, and includes features like Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication. Configuration is managed via `application.properties` for the backend and environment variables for the frontend.
*   **[spring_boot_ai_agent](https://github.com/SteffenHebestreit/spring_boot_ai_agent):** A Spring Boot application designed for AI research, serving as the backend for AI chat applications. It features task management, interaction with LLMs (OpenAI compatible), multimodal content support (images, PDFs), dynamic LLM capability detection, 100% MCP-compliant integration with external MCP servers, robust chat functionality with persistence, and peer-to-peer A2A communication. Key technologies include Spring Boot, Java 21, Maven, and H2 (default). 
*   **[ai-chat-frontend](https://github.com/SteffenHebestreit/ai-chat-frontend):** A React-based frontend for an AI chat application, powered by Vite. It features a dynamic 3D orb visualization (Three.js), chat history, real-time messaging with markdown, dynamic LLM model selection, and comprehensive multimodal content support (text, images, PDFs) with smart capability detection and file handling. Key technologies include React, Vite, Three.js, and Axios.
*   **[color-scheme-generator](https://github.com/SteffenHebestreit/color-scheme-generator):** A responsive web-based tool for generating color schemes. It features dynamic hue selection using a custom JavaScript `HuePicker` component, generates 11 shades for primary, secondary, and tertiary colors using the OKLCH color model, and persists user selections in localStorage. The project demonstrates modern CSS including Grid, Custom Properties, and Container Queries, and includes styled form components.
*   **[webcrawl-mcp](https://github.com/SteffenHebestreit/webcrawl-mcp):** A 100% compliant Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for web crawling. This reference implementation provides a suite of tools for web crawling, including basic and smart crawling, link extraction, sitemap generation, and page content search. It supports both modern Streamable HTTP and legacy SSE transport methods and is built with Node.js and TypeScript.
